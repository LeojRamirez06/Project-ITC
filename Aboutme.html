        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> Good day! My name is Leoj Ramirez, and I'd want to take this opportunity to introduce myself. I am an eighteen-year-old teenager. I am a first-year student at Adamson University, seeking a bachelor's degree in information technology. I used to be fascinated by how programs, applications, and other electronic devices functioned when I was younger. It drew my attention so much that I decided to enroll in adamson to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am a trustworthy person with whom you can speak and seek assistance if necessary. I also enjoy playing online games, singing, and dancing. I strive to reach my goals and do my work with passion someday, and I hope you will as well. It was a pleasure to meet you! </p>
