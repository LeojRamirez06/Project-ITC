<h1>SINGING</h1>

<p>When I was younger, I always wanted to sing, but I have a terrible voice. Fortunately, I met a friend who taught me how to listen to music, sing, and be confident in myself. After that, I began practicing my singing skills as part of my hobbies, and after several processes, I was ready to sing.</p>
