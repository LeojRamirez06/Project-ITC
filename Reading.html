<h1>READING MANHWA/MANGA</h1>

<p>When I was in grade 11,  a friend of mine recommended this manhwa called "The Beginning After the End." It was a good manhwa with a good story. After that, I read almost 50 manhwa and I really love and like it; sometimes I read 100 chapters of manhwa/manga a day, and I also spend my free time reading.</p>
